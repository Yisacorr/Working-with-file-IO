# Working-with-file-IO
A program that displays statistical information about US states and 
territories and their populations. The data for the states is stored in the file ‘StatePops.txt’. 
The number of states in the file is unknown. I used a pair of parallel ArrayLists to store the states (Strings) and their 
populations (Integers).
